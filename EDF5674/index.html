        <h2>Why are we introducing the unit?</h2>
        <p><strong>EDF5674</strong> is designed for Master of Teaching and Master of Education students who wish to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand science as it is actually practiced in contemporary scientific settings</li>
            <li>Improve their teaching by incorporating contemporary scientific practices into their classroom practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What will be involved?</h2>
        <p>The unit will be delivered in collaboration with the Faculty of Science.</p>

        <h2>Unit learning outcomes</h2>
        <p>Upon successful completion of this unit students should be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>articulate how they have extended their current knowledge skills and abilities needed as a science educator</li>
            <li>demonstrate an understanding of the ways in which science responds to technological and social change</li>
            <li>demonstrate engagement with the contemporary practices of science</li>
            <li>demonstrate the connections between contemporary science practices and one’s educational practice.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>What will assessment involve?</h2>
        <p>Assessment will comprise two tasks. The first will involve the <strong>production of a multimedia representation</strong> which examines the contemporary knowledge skills and abilities in science education. The second task will be a <strong>written assignment</strong> that connects contemporary science practices with the student’s classroom practices.</p>
        <h2>What will the workload be?</h2>
        <p>This is a 12 point unit. The minimum total workload equals 288 hours per semester, comprising: 12 contact hours and 24 hours equivalent of online activities over the semester or 36 hours equivalent of online activities over the semester, plus independent study to meet the minimum required hours per semester.</p>
