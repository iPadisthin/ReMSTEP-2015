        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>We've had a very busy and productive year on the ReMSTEP project. The focus of Year One has been on co-design of potential courses and activities to support ReMSTEP goals and objectives, across the science, mathematics and education faculties.  A number of critical milestones have been met, including the development of collaborative relationships and the design of learning resources incorporating cutting edge science practices. Approximately seventy students took part in ReMSTEP activities and pilots across partner universities. More information can be found in partner updates, provided below.</p>
        <p>Key events and dissemination activities in 2014 included:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Project Launch</strong> &ndash; March 24th, 2014. Over fifty guests from the STEM community, government, and education sector, attended the Launch. For example, stakeholders from the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, Independent Schools Victoria, maths and science teachers associations, the Office for Learning and Teaching and partner centres were in attendance. The project launch presentations are available on our website.</li>
            <li><strong>Inaugural Annual Evaluation and Dissemination Workshop</strong> for the Enhancing the Training of Mathematics and Science Teachers Program (ETMST) &ndash; March 28th, 2014. Professor Dinham gave an overview of the project goals and planned activities, on behalf of the project team. This was the first opportunity for the project team to network with other projects within ETMST Program.</li>
            <li><strong>Project’s first external Reference Group meeting</strong> &ndash; November 5th, 2014. In the morning there were scheduled presentations to inform the reference group about project activities. In the afternoon two workshops were facilitated by the project team: STEM Innovative Pedagogies and Project Evaluation Case Study. It was a productive meeting overall, with a strong focus on sustainable models of change and authentic collaborations that will exist beyond the life of the project.</li>

        <h2>Partner updates</h2>
        
        <h3>Deakin University</h3>
        <p>Deakin has been extremely active in seeking to enrich student learning experiences through access to specialist science and maths centres. At the <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/ifm/" rel="external">Institute for Frontier Materials</a> Deakin pre-service teachers (Chemistry) are engaged in one on one engagements with researchers to develop a teaching resource that addresses key criteria, including identifying the practices used by the scientists’ to develop knowledge, and identifying links to Chemistry in curriculum.</p>
        <p>At the <a href="http://www.gtac.edu.au/" rel="external">Gene Technology Access Centre</a>, Deakin (and University of Melbourne) pre-service students, GTAC staff, scientists and teacher educators are collaborating to produce educative resources that interpret cutting edge science for both pre-service teacher education programs and schools.</p>
        <p>Components for three topics of study (stem cells, the bionic eye and adaptations) will be developed by the three core working teams with representation from GTAC, teacher educators, primary / secondary school education students and industry-based experts. A management team, comprising of ReMSTEP and GTAC representatives will oversee the overall process.</p>
        <p>Discussions are underway with the <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/" rel="external">Melbourne Museum</a> in identifying ways Deakin can access the Museum’s collections and research scientists as part of its education programs.</p>
        
        <h3>La Trobe</h3>
        <p>As part of its SPIEs focus - Scientists as Partners In Education – pre-service teachers at La Trobe (both Primary and Secondary) are working in partnership with science researchers (Future Fellows) to gain a personal experience of contemporary science.  The students are taking on, as an aspect of this experience, the development of a learning activity that they will trial with a class in their upcoming teaching practicum. Activities will include: profiling the nature of the work of scientists through personal stories (Science as Human Endeavour), providing contemporary examples of the way scientists work (Science Inquiry) and integrating new areas of science into the curriculum.</p>
        <p>LaTrobe has established a partnership with Quantum Victoria, and discussions are underway around involving science students to work in partnership with Quantum program developers and enabling pre-service teachers to engage with innovative areas of science and the explicit pedagogy of science inquiry.</p>

        <h3>Monash University</h3>
        <p>At Monash University the Education and Science faculties are working together to develop new units of study for their Masters of Teaching and Bachelor of Science programs. The benefit will be to enhance student understanding of contemporary science, scientific processes, and science communication. Planning is also underway to potentially introduce a vertical double degree at Monash in 2016.</p>
        <p>The <a href="/SCI3910/">Schools Science project (SCI3910)</a> is a new elective being offered in Semester 2, 2015 to undegraduate Science students. It provides an opportunity for science students to develop and deliver teaching activities in a primary or secondary school.</p>
        <p>The <a href="/EDF5674/">Engaging with practices of contemporary science (EDF5674)</a> is a new elective being offered in Semester 2, 2015 to Master of Teaching/Master of Education students. It provides an opportunity for students to experience science as it is actually practiced in contemporary scientific settings, and understand how to translate such practices into their classroom teaching.</p>
        
        <h3>University of Melbourne</h3>
        <p>At the University of Melbourne the Masters of Teaching (Primary) program is introducing new Science and Maths specialist pathways to its overall structure. The major impact will be the graduation of a select group of teachers with specialised knowledge in Maths and Science teaching, pedagogy, curriculum, skills and resources. The course structure has been designed in collaboration with faculties of science, maths and education.</p>
        <p>The first Science and Maths elective was offered in July 2014 at the Melbourne Graduate School of Education and brought together science, maths and education staff in a collaborative relationship with pre-service candidates and the existing teaching profession.</p>
        <p>The University of Melbourne, with Deakin, are currently collaborating with the <a href="http://www.gtac.edu.au/" rel="external">Gene Technology Access Centre</a> in the development, trialling and evaluation three new topics of study.</p>
        <p>Also at the University of Melbourne, faculties of Science and Education are coming together to design a ‘School as Breadth’ experience for undergraduate science students. This initiative will provide the opportunity to Masters of Science students to gain school experience to promote teaching as a career. The plan will work towards engagements with specialist science and maths centres.</p>
        <p>Discussions are also underway with the <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/" rel="external">Melbourne Museum</a> in identifying ways the University of Melbourne can access the Museum’s collections and research scientists as part of its education programs.</p>
